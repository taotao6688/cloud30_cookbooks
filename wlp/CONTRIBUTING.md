# Contributing to WebSphere Liberty Profile Chef Cookbook

We welcome contributions but request that you follow these guidelines.

## Bugs

Please raise any bug reports on the project's [issue tracker][]. 
Be sure to search the list to see if your issue has already been raised.

A good bug report is one that make it easy for us to understand what you were
trying to do and what went wrong. Also, provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.

## New features

Please raise any new feature requests on the project's [issue tracker][].

## Pull-Requests

### Changes to existing code

If you want to raise a pull-request with a new feature, or a refactoring of existing code, make sure to open an issue in the project's [issue tracker][] first before engaging in serious development work. This will start a discussion and help in accepting the pull-request.

### Coding standards

Please ensure you follow the coding standards used through-out the existing
code base. Some basic rules include:

 - all files must have the Apache license in the header.
 - indent with 2 spaces, no tabs. No arguments.

### Contributor License Agreement

In order for us to accept pull-requests, the contributor must first complete
a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This clarifies the intellectual 
property license granted with any contribution. It is for your protection as a 
Contributor as well as the protection of IBM and its customers; it does not 
change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You can download the CLAs here:

 - [individual](http://wasdev.github.io/legal/wasdev-cla-individual.pdf)
 - [corporate](http://wasdev.github.io/legal/wasdev-cla-corporate.pdf)

If you are an IBMer, please contact us directly as the contribution process is
slightly different.
